  <title>Where Will I Find $LANGUAGE Developers to Maintain It?</title>

        <para>
          This question immediately assumes that it is already possible to find developers who "know $MORE_FAMILIAR_LANGUAGE" easier.

        <para>
          An enormous majority of programmers know very little about the programming language with which they work.

    <title>So what then?</title>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          This implies that knowledge of the programming language is vastly over-estimated in its importance to productivity, since developers are already productive with an extremely poor understanding of their programming language.

        <para>
          ...to such an extent that we should dismiss it.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          ...and parody it by observing its arbitrariness. "Where will I ever find a developer who is familiar with leaving line 68 blank!?"
